            <li>3 tablespoons good olive oil</li>
            <li>4 ounces small-diced pancetta</li>
            <li>3 pounds boneless short ribs, cut in 1.5" chunks</li>
            <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cognac or brandy</li>
            <li>1 cup hearty red wine</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped yellow onions</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped fennel, trimmed and cored</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 can of diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>1 pound carrots, scrubbed, cut 1/2 inch thick</li>
            <li>1 pound yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed, 1 inch diced</li>
            <li>10 ounces frozen peas</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="small-headers">Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 300 F</li>
            <li> Heat the oil in a large (11- to 12-inch) 
                Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the pancetta 
                and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until browned. With 
                a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a 
                plate lined with a paper towel and set aside.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, season the short ribs all over with 2 
                teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Brown half 
                the meat in the Dutch oven over medium heat, 
                turning occasionally, for 5 to 7 minutes, until 
                browned on all sides. Transfer the meat to a bowl 
                and brown the second batch. (Don’t cook them all in 
                one batch or they won’t brown!) Transfer the second 
                batch to the bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li> Off the heat, add the Cognac and 1/3 cup of the 
                wine to the pot, scraping up any browned bits, then 
                simmer over medium heat for one minute. Add the onions 
                and fennel and sauté, stirring occasionally, for 7 to 8 
                minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Add the garlic 
                and cook for one minute.</li>
            <li> Stir the tomatoes and tomato paste into the vegetables. 
                Add the remaining 2/3 cup of wine, the beef broth, the seared 
                meat (and juices), 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. 
                Bring to a simmer, cover and bake for 1 1/4 hours, checking 
                occasionally to be sure the liquid is simmering.</li>
            <li> Degrease the stew, if necessary. Stir in the carrots and 
                potatoes, cover and bake for one hour longer, until the 
                vegetables and meat are very tender when tested with a fork. 
                Just before serving, stir in the peas and pancetta, taste for 
                seasonings and serve hot in large, shallow bowls.</li>
        </ol>
