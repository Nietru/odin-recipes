    <h1>Salmon Dinner Recipe</h1>

    <img src="images/salmondinner.jpg" alt="an artsy black bowl with a filet of salmon fingerling potatoes and broccoli">

    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Delicious baked salmon with crispy potatoes, broccoli, 
            and the most amazing life-changing lemon sauce smothered 
            on top of it all. This is restaurant bistro-style eating!</p>
        <p>Baked salmon, simply salted, peppered, brushed with olive 
            oil, and baked to flaky perfection: absolutely.
            And enter -> the herby, creamy, lemony lemon sauce. 
            Yes, yes, and y-e-s. Everything else is delicious, but 
            if we’re being honest, it really just serves in the supporting 
            role for this sauce.</p>
    
    <h3 class="small-headers">Ingredients:</h3>
            <h4>For Sheet Pan</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound small gold potatoes, cut into bite sizes</li>
            <li>olive oil, garlic powder, salt, pepper</li>
            <li>2-3 cups of broccoli florets</li>
            <li>1-2 pounds of salmon cut into 2-4 filets</li>
        </ul>
            <h4>Lemon Herb Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6-8 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1-2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
            <li>2-3 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>chopped fresh parsley or basil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="small-headers">Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Roast the Potatoes: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
                Line a baking sheet with parchment. Add the potatoes 
                to the pan and toss with a little bit of olive oil, 
                garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Roast for 25 minutes 
                until lightly browned and delicious.</li>
            <li>Make the Life-Changingly Delicious Sauce: While the 
                potatoes are roasting, make your sauce. Melt the 
                butter over medium low heat (I usually start with 6 
                tablespoons and add the last two if needed once the 
                sauce is cooked). Add the garlic, shallot, and thyme 
                sprigs; sauté for 3-5 minutes until soft and fragrant.
                 Add broth and cream; bring to a low simmer. Let the 
                 sauce hang out over low heat until it starts to 
                 thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove 
                 the thyme sprigs. Whisk in the lemon juice, stir in 
                 the herbs, and season with salt and pepper. 
                 Give it a taste.</li>
            <li>Bake the Salmon and Broccoli: Add the broccoli and 
                the salmon to the potato pan (keeping the potatoes on 
                there). Toss or brush with a little more oil, salt, 
                and pepper. Bake for another 10-15 minutes, until the 
                salmon is fully cooked – I like it to be *just* past 
                the point of translucent where it flakes apart very 
                easily but isn’t dried out.</li>
            <li>You’re Done: Serve salmon, potatoes, and broccoli with
                 big spoonfuls of sauce, more herbs, and more lemon 
                 wedges. This is living.</li>
        </ol>
